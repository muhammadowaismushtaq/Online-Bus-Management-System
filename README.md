# Online-Bus-Management-System

## Description
The purpose of the project entitled as “OBMS - Online Bus Management System” is to 
computerize the Bus Management System for Adda Managers via developing Web based software 
which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost effective. It allows Manager to not only remotely 
access to all the details of bus but access for insertion, alteration, and deletion of any specific 
details related to bus service such as inserting the details of new bus, route, stop, or deriver etc. 
Traditionally, it was done manually. Which was not only very time consuming, but also very 
difficult in case of how to show to updated details to customers (passengers). Hence, we have 
given an access for passenger too, which helps them to see all the updated details anytime from 
anywhere. However, the main features such as add/update/delete data from the database is 
accessible only to its administrators. Only they can add/update/delete data from the database. The 
data can be retrieved easily. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data 
processing very fast. Online Bus Management System is winning over the traditional management 
methods due to its efficiency.
